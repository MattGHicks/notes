## Where I Left Off
Completed deployment fixes for Nixpacks/Railway - added startup script to set DATABASE_URL at runtime. App is functional with core features: create/edit/delete notes, folder organization, search, and theme switching. Next steps could include: adding markdown export, note sharing, or tags/labels for better organization.
